# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying tweets into three sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. Using pre-processed Twitter data, we implemented and compared three machine learning models:
1. **Logistic Regression** (Baseline Model)
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
3. **Neural Networks** (PyTorch)

The project evaluates the models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized tweets, removed noise (URLs, punctuation, etc.), and transformed text using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Modeling**: Built three classification models using Scikit-learn and PyTorch.
- **Evaluation**: Compared models using multiple metrics to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **Insights**: Analyzed model performance, addressed challenges (e.g., class imbalance), and provided recommendations.
